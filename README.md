# odin-recipes
Right now, this for me is just a simple project that I am learning. I am teaching myself web developement and I will be pushing this through git into my repository. I think this will be a site where I can upload recipes and stuff, which I guess is pretty cool. Once I am done with this project, I will write a reflection and push again.
  
Alright, time for an update. This was super easy. Kind of time-consuming, but stuff like that happens. I got a little annoyed with making the list format pretty, but it didn't take more than 10 minutes. Overall, very happy.
