# odin-recipes
"Right now, this for me is just a simple project that I am learning."
"I am teaching myself web developement and I will be pushing this through git into my repository."
"I think this will be a site where I can upload recipes and stuff, which I guess is pretty cool."
"Once I am done with this project, I will write a reflection and push again."
